# **INTRODUCTION.** 

Many people aspire to leave a lasting impact that will endure beyond their lifetime, and there are various ways to achieve this, such as through financial means, creating or developing something during their lifetime, touching other people's lives, or leaving behind a thriving business or company. For instance, if you store your insights, experiences, and knowledge only in personal tools such as note-taking apps, they might be lost forever after one passes away. No one knows when they will die even if you decide to publish your notes before death. 

Collective learning is crucial for the advancement of human knowledge over time. Therefore, if we cannot access the information we have learned throughout our life, it would be a significant loss for everyone. It is important to ensure that your knowledge and insights are not isolated but instead contribute to the collective understanding of humanity. 

GLASP (short for Greatest Legacy Accumulated as Shared Proof) is a web application that addresses the problem of how to leave behind a good legacy, and could ultimately give users an in-depth insight into the lives of people that have lived. It can be downloaded from the Google Chrome Web Store and Mac App Store and provides a platform for users to share their knowledge and accumulate a legacy that can endure over time. Glasp offers hope to individuals that it is never too late to start building a legacy that can have a lasting impact.

# **WHAT IS GLASP?**

GLASP is a web-only tool designed to speed up the process of highlighting quotes and ideas found online such as on the Internet. This application permits users to highlight ideas and organize their discoveries without flipping between displays regularly. This feature allows users to focus on the material they've uncovered without being distracted, which saves time. 

GLASP **(short for Greatest Legacy Accumulated as Shared Proof)** is a social web highlighter that was designed to help individuals, groups, and organizations highlight and share important information on the web. The idea behind GLASP is to allow users to highlight specific pieces of text, images, or videos on a web page and share them with others. This can be useful in a variety of contexts, such as education, research, and collaboration. For example, students can use GLASP to highlight key points in a reading assignment and share them with classmates, while researchers can use it to annotate relevant sections of academic papers and share them with colleagues.

GLASP is a platform-based solution that connects users with others that share common interests. This creates a community where users may exchange knowledge and learn from one another's expertise. Users can also access content highlighted by others, which can help to broaden their viewpoints and comprehension of various subjects.

Additionally, GLASP allows users to leave a digital imprint for future generations. Users can add to humanity's knowledge base by curating and categorizing their information utilizing this tool. This is essential in today's digital world, where information overload is an increasing cause for worry. Users can leave their imprint on history and guarantee that their insights remain intact in the vast amount of information by contributing to the existing knowledge base.

Finally, GLASP gives users the possibility to work for themselves. Users can improve their skills and knowledge in their areas of interest by using the tool to highlight and organize their results. As users gain proficiency in their chosen field, this can lead to job advancement and personal development, as users become more skilled in their areas.

# **IS THERE A REASON FOR GLASP?**

The main reason why GLASP was developed as stated by Kazuki Nakayashiki, was to "democratize access to other people's learning and experiences that they have collected throughout their life as a utilitarian legacy”. The goals of GLASP's co-founder and CEO were to "create a system that allows everyone to share and develop their learnings as their legacy in a natural way". Kazuki wished to create a method by which people may pass on their wisdom to subsequent generations.

GLASP as a product was built to help people who die pass on their legacy to the rest of humanity. This could be done by creating a trajectory with the experiences of people who have lived, so others could inherit the same path this person took. 
 
The objective of GLASP is to enable easy and immediate access to the vast amount of highlighted information available on the internet. Rather than requiring users to sift through various web pages, the aim is to provide a platform that consolidates and organizes highlighted content. This platform would allow users to access relevant and useful information with a single click, saving time and effort.

The platform's design would consider various factors such as the sources of information, the relevance and usefulness of the highlighted content, and the organization of the content. By providing access to a curated selection of highlighted information, users can easily find and access the information they need without having to navigate through multiple web pages. This would streamline the process of searching for information, leading to increased efficiency and productivity. 

Moreover, providing access to highlighted information with a single click can also contribute to collective learning. By accessing the insights and ideas of others, users can broaden their perspectives and deepen their understanding of various topics. This could lead to more collaboration, innovation, and progress in various fields.
